I take the first 10 points of each 2D journey in TSPLIB as a data sample
```
{
    "sample": [ [x, y], [x, y], ...],
    "optimalTour": [Indices],
    "cost": #no
  },
```

## data_2.json
I take 2D journeys in TSPLIB, and cut them to variable size journeys in the range between 9 and 22.

{
    "sample": [ [x, y], [x, y], ...],
    "optimalTour": [Indices],
    "cost": #no
